# Python University Assignments

## Description

This repository contains projects and assignments related to the Python course at the university. The projects cover various aspects of Python programming, including design patterns, algorithms, object-oriented programming, library management, practical tests, and a quiz game that can serve as the final exam.

## Project Structure

1. **Dynamic Programming & Algorithms:**
   - I used Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Greedy and some sorting algorithms.

2 **OOP:**
   - All projects are based on OOP. We used Inheritance and Layered Arhitecture. UI -> Service -> Repository -> Domain.

3. **LibraryManagement:**
   - [a8_problem]:  Here is a project with Library Managment. We have Rentals, Books, Statistics. You can rent a book for a number of days.
   - [a9_problemfp]: Here is a project with Library Managment. We have Rentals, Books, Statistics. You can rent a book for a number of days. Undo/Redo for all commands.

4. **PracticalTests:**
   - [t2_tenis]: I need to implement an algorithm for Tenis Tournament. 

5. **QuizGame:**
   - [Tests_Laboratory/Practic Exam]: Quiz Game with Generator for questions. You can Create a quiz and store in a file. Every quiz have a difficulty. Every question have 3 options and only one correct answer. You obtain a point for each correct answer.
  
**I used PyUnit Testes and Specifications for all Projects.**

## How to Run Projects

Each project has its own installation and run instructions. You need Python and some modules (PyGame, TextTable, Random, Copy...)
